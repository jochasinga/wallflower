A data flow implementation of a virtual machine.

## description

At this point it is a collection of gate-level logics implemented as Pure Data abstractions. More complex logics are built on-top of small ones creating the whole logic circuit layer of a computing machine.

Shown above is a 1-bit binary adder logic circuit, Where `A` and `B` are operands, `Ci` is the immediate carry, `Ci+1` is the next carry, and `S` is the sum of `A + B`.
